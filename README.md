## About LAC
**Literary Affairs Committee** is a place where people share their passion for the art of speaking, reading, and writing. It includes fierce debaters, bold orators, quirky quizzers, avid readers, and literature enthusiasts. LAC nurtures budding writers, Quiz Masters, and bold speakers who are not afraid to put their opinion out in the public. 

LAC stands on three pillars: **Speaking** , **Quizzing** and **Reading**. Alongside the technical knowledge we gain in college, it is essential to have the soft skills that are needed to communicate the knowledge to the common audience. LAC provides a platform for the students of the college to hone their soft skills through various Debate and Group Discussion workshops and competitions. 

We tease the wits of college students through various quizzes that cover all the topics ever known to man. LAC has conducted a national quiz and an Inter NIT Quiz hosting the most inquisitive minds from all over the nation to test out their deduction skills through twisted questions. 

LAC also hosts a **Book Club** at the Central Library with up to 200 non-academic books to choose from, genres varying from fiction, fantasy, and romance to self help, biographies, and history .
